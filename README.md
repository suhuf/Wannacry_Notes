This is an unprofessional archive of some of my notes when following Stacksmasher's tutorial on wannacry reversing link (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sv8yu12y5zM&pp=ygUWc3RhY2sgc21hc3RlciB3YW5uYWNyeQ%3D%3D)

The version of wannacry used here is a different variant of the malware. from what I can tell. This variant most likely was developed after the first one used in the video. It has optimized for loops, less unnecessary functions, more verbosity, and more parts to it.

As a result, the code output and analysis differs in some parts to stacksmasher's video.
